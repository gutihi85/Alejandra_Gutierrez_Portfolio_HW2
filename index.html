            <p id="text">I am a Toy Designer, passionate about education through play, with a stron experience in product development and licensing. Every dream I have been able to accomplish, has been tahnks to my father's big dreams, innovation and expertise as a software developer back in the 70's. Even though I love the career I chose and had a blast studying and actually working in the industry, I always had the thought of trying out what my genes can accomplish. So here I am, studying to, hopefully, become like my dad, and be able to enhance my dreams! </p>
